# Portability
To ensure portability and ease the setup of the evaluation environment, this template makes heavy
use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Of course, this can be swapped out for any other such
tool, so long as the artifact remains reasonably portable between different platforms and
configurations. Common alternatives include [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and
[Nix](https://nixos.org/).

In any case, it is good practice to **thoroughly document** software _and_ hardware dependencies,
and to provide solutions or alternatives when possible.
