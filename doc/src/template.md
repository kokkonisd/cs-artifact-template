# The artifact template in detail
This section explains how to set up an artifact using this template in detail, including the
changes that need to be made to the individual template files.

It also explains how to use the artifact to both _run the experiments_ for the paper and to
_reproduce_ the experiments (e.g., for an Artifact Evaluation track).
