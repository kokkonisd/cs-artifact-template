# A simple example
In order to understand how the template works, we are going to apply it to a concrete example.
For the sake of this example, we will imagine a made-up paper, titled _Spellcheck: Checking New
Spells_, which introduces a new spellchecking approach and tool called _Spellcheck_, and was
published in the prestigious _CONF'99_ conference.

Following the template, this section will walk you through the two repositories: the `spellcheck`
tool repository and the `spellcheck-confYY-artifact` artifact repository.

For the sake of clarity and brevity, this example is obviously simplified; if you are interested in
a real use case, see <https://github.com/binsec/rosa> and <https://zenodo.org/records/14724251>.
