# Motivation

This template exists mainly for two reasons:

1. There is a
   [real problem of missing, incomplete or otherwise unsatisfactory research artifacts](https://a3nm.net/work/research/wrong/#Supplementary)
   in Computer Science. In my personal experience, this seems to be caused mostly by _inertia_ (or
   laziness), as proper preparation of an artifact for publication is (or should be) in some ways
   similar to the
   [practice of software release](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/),
   which of course demands some organizational effort. A template could ease some of that pain by
   providing a base to construct upon.
2. Since the work of constructing an artifact should be a core part of research (and not just an
   afterthought), and in the interest of reproducibility, the artifact itself could (and should) be
   used for any experiments presented in the paper.[^1] This ensures that the very environment which
   produced the data shown in the paper is available to anyone, such as artifact evaluators,
   essentially guaranteeing a smooth reproduction of the experiments.

[^1]: Of course, this should be done during the latest phase of experimentation, when there is a clear
    understanding of which experimental results are needed for the paper. It is not worthwhile to
    develop a stable, publishable artifact during the prototyping phase, when experimental results
    are not yet clear and the fate of the paper is still largely undecided.
