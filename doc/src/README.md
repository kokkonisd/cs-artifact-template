# Introduction
This template is intended to be used as a base when building a new artifact (e.g., tools, proofs,
data) to accompany a published paper. It is heavily geared towards Computer Science (as that is my
own field), but may be repurposed for other scientific domains.

The documentation is divided into the following sections:
- [_Motivation_](./motivation.md): the motivation behind this template;
- [_Portability_](./portability.md): how to ensure that the artifact can work on different
  machines;
- [_Architecture_](./architecture.md): a high-level description of the architecture of the artifact
  template;
- [_A simple example_](./example.md): walk-through of a concrete example of an artifact using the
  template;
- [_The artifact template in detail_](./template.md): a detailed technical guide on using the
  template for your own artifacts.
