# CS artifact template
This is a simple template for an artifact in the form of a Docker image, to accompany a scientific
paper. It's tailored for typical Computer Science artifacts, but can potentially serve as a basis
for other types of artifacts.


## How to use
The artifact template itself can be found in the [`template/`](./template/) directory.
However, it is made to work as a part of a greater "infrastructure", built around a _tool repo_ and
an _artifact repo_. In order to simultaneously showcase this infrastructure and keep the actual
template clean, an example is provided in the [`example/`](./example/) directory.

A detailed guide, walking through the example an explaining a real use case, can be found in the
[documentation](https://kokkonisd.github.io/cs-artifact-template). (The Markdown source of the
documentation itself can be found in the [`doc/`](./doc/) directory.)
